# Various assorted datasets

Various assorted datasets from or about Slovakia.

We prefer data to be published properly, but sometimes "properly" is for
various reasons not possible, so then we will use this repository.

## municipalities_sk.json

[municipalities_sk.json](municipalities_sk.json) contains population per
municipality in Slovakia, along with postal code (PSČ) of the municipality.

## postalcodecoordinates_sk.json

[postalcodecoordinates_sk.json](postalcodecoordinates_sk.json) contains GPS
coordinates for postal code (PSČ) of Slovak municipalities. Postal codes
